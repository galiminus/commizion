                Here you can create <strong>as many original characters as you like</strong>, or even several
                versions of the same character.

              %p
                After creating your character all you have to do is selecting it when you take a new
                commission from an artist. You can also <strong>share your character page outside of Commizion.</strong>

              %p
                Keep in mind that your character description and reference (if you have one) must be <strong>precise
                and accurate</strong> so it's easier for the artists to draw your character with all the details you care about :3
